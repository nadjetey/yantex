Love it :)
Would love option to hide 'Other Bookmarks' Column as I don't use it :)"

While this works, I miss the rest of the homepage functionality.
Proposal for the way it should work: add another "tab" at the bottom: Most Visited, Apps, Bookmarks. Remember selected tab when opening new pages.

Feature Request: Ability to sort folders and bookmarks by Date modified or created, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, ability to sort bookmarks and folders manually in any order (with that order retained the next time a new tab is opened). Currently, bookmarks/folders are sorted alphabetically for us.

Feature request: ability to right click on a bookmarks folder and open all links.

I am assuming this extension is no longer supported, but if it is, please fix the 'Open in a new tab' issue previously posted.

It's a really great substitution for new tab/home page, but it has a problem where some links get stuck in 'Open in new tab'

Excellent!
Feature suggestions:
- I could not drag and drop a bookmark from one folder to another and I miss it. Indeed, this nice overview of our bookmarks gives immediately some ideas to reorganize them...
- the default tab of Chrome shows applications too. Could it be possible to show them too?
- Last 10 used bookmarks or 10 most used bookmars.

It is really great. But I found a problem. I surf internet by a 36 inch display, the font of Bookmarks Home Page is not adjusted with setting, it is too small.

love this, wish it would work in incognito mode as well
